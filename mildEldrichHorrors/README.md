These are blueprints and scenes that I didn't originally intend to upload but decided to upload anyway just because of how much work I put into them, and I want to see them actually used by someone who would appreciate the insanity.

These blueprints and associated dependencies/assets most likely will never receive any maintenance unless by popular request or paid commission.

No need to thank me, but if you insist, feel free to drop a few bucks in my tip-jar. My tip-jar: (https://ko-fi.com/commander_phoenix_#)
