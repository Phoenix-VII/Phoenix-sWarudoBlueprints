I originally created this blueprint specifically for a vtuber I used to work with. But since I don't work with them anymore, and there has been no exclusivity agreement or any contracts, I'm posting this blueprint so that someone would make real use of it.

This requires Feline's Heart Containers as a dependency. It can be found at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3016017071&searchtext=heart+container

Add the entire Undertale folder to your Warudo\Warudo_Data\StreamingAssets\Images folder. I did not create these sprites, and I didn't ask any questions about where they came from; if anyone happens to know or has found out where the source is, please let me know so that I can give credit.

No need to thank me, but if you insist, feel free to drop a few bucks in my tip-jar. My tip-jar: (https://ko-fi.com/commander_phoenix_#)
